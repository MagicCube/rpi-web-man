# rpi-man
A web-based management tool for Raspberry PI / Raspbian.

YES, indeed it is powered by `Node.js v6` on `Raspberry PI 3`.

>  This project is inspired by [vaslabs's](https://github.com/vaslabs) [pi-web-agent](https://github.com/vaslabs/pi-web-agent/wiki/A-web-application-agent-for-the-Raspberry-Pi) which is unfortunately not working for my Raspberry PI (I still don't know why...)



## 1. Features

* A web-based management tool for Raspberry PI. You can treat it like the web interface to the routers.
* Modern user interface.
* You can easily use it to
  * Monitor CPU & memory usage / CPU temperature
  * Start / stop / restart services
  * Web-based terminal
  * Reboot
* It also provide RESTful APIs for the further integrations.



## 2. Requirements
### 2.1 Equipment
* [**Raspberry PI 3 Model B**](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) with the latest **Raspbian OS** installed
* **Node.js v6.0**
  + By default Node.js v0.x is installed in the Raspbian, you need to uninstall it first if you want to have a try of this project.

    ```shell
    $ sudo apt-get uninstall nodejs
    ```
* One more thing, you need to run it as root user, or at least sudoer.
